I desided to go with react for client-side code and firebase for storage, i also used bootsrap for design.
The things that i am most proud of is:

- It is easy to use. You can use the enter key on you keybord to add and save items.
- I did it easy to add items on startup with the focus keyword.
- When you edit the input on a item it adds two buttons for the save and 
undo functions and is not there all the time.
- As soon as you add something it is added to all browsers.
- The code is simple and easy to understand.
- You do not have to write any backside code with firebase, 
you can change to any other firebase page and everything will just work.





	###Instructions how to use:
- To add a item type with your keybord and push enter
- To set a item as done click the checkbox on the left
- To delete an item click the delete button on the right
- To edit a item click on the item and enter the desided text and click the save button,
- you can also undo undesired edits with the undo button.
